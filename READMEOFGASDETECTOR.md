# Arduino Gas Leakage Detector 

This is an Arduino Uno-based gas leakage detector using an MQ-2 sensor. The system detects flammable gas and activates a buzzer and LED when gas levels cross a threshold.

## Components Used

1.MQ-5 gas sensor
2.Arduino UNO
3.5v exhaust fan
4.5v LED
6.9v battery
7.5V relay module
8.SPST switch
9.wires 
10.5v active buzzer
11.DC fan.

##  How It Works

1. MQ-5 detects gas (LPG, smoke, methane, etc.).
2. If the gas level exceeds the threshold, the buzzer and LED are triggered.
3. That shows that main MCB is off and only a buzzere with is connected to a different battery will start
3. Safe levels turn everything off.
